# jmusic-lilypond

This project is used together with jmusic-model. The intent of this project is to provide import and export between (a subset of) Lilypond format and the jmusic model.

Ultimately the should accept all Lilypond notation, even syntax it does not understand, and save the unknown code in the same way as it was loaded.
